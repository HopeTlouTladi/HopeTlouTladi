Data Scientist | Machine Learning Practitioner

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a data scientist with a strong scientific background and practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. I enjoy working with data to build understanding, develop predictive models, and communicate findings clearly.

My path into data science started with studying Physics and Chemistry at the University of Limpopo, where I developed analytical and quantitative thinking skills. I have since expanded my technical expertise through industry training, certifications, and hands-on projects.

I am passionate about continuous learning, applying machine learning techniques, and building solutions that have real-world impact.
